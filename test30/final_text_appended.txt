3;;ff1 fs2;;1.1  The z14: A secure platform integrated and open by design
4;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 introduces a paradigm shift for protecting data and transactions, from selective encryption to pervasive encryption.
5;;ff2 fs3;;1
6;;ff2 fs0;; It includes higher-performance processors and co-processors, increased cache density, up to 32 TB of memory, enhanced access to data, improved virtualization for running Linux on z Systems, and enhancements for Java and other compilers.
7;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 offers a fast, scalable, and securable enterprise system. Compared to its predecessor platforms, the z14 provides more of what you need to satisfy today’s growing IT demands:
8;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Compute power for increased throughput</ff2>
9;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Large-scale memory to process data faster</ff2>
10;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Industry-unique cache design to optimize performance</ff2>
11;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Accelerated I/O bandwidth to process massive amounts of data</ff2>
12;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Data compression to economically store and process information</ff2>
13;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>High-speed cryptographic operations to help secure transactions and data</ff2>
14;;ff2 fs0;;From the hundreds of microprocessors to the software stack, the z14 is built to quickly respond to change. This evolution of the Z platform embodies a proven infrastructure designed from the ground up for data and transactions. Figure 1-1 shows the z14.
15;;ff4 fs1;;Figure 1-1   The IBM z14
16;;ff2 fs0;;The new Z platform incorporates the ability to access larger data in memory, and has industry-exclusive I/O processors for offloading data-intensive workloads. 
17;;ff2 fs4;;1  
18;;ff2 fs3;;Pervasive encryption is a data-centric approach to information security that entails protecting data entering and exiting the z14 platform through widespread encryption. See “Pervasive encryption” on page 82 for more information.

27;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Blending open source and Z technologies</ff2>
28;;ff1 fs5;;1.1.1  Securing data with pervasive encryption
29;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 excels with security features that are built into the hardware, firmware, and operating systems. The built-in features range from storage protection keys and workload isolation to granular audit capabilities, and more. The Central Processor Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF), standard on every core, supports pervasive encryption and provides hardware acceleration for encryption operations. In addition, the new Crypto Express6S gets a performance boost on z14. Combined, these two enhancements perform encryption more efficiently on the z14 than on earlier Z platforms.
30;;ff2 fs0;;IBM Z pervasive encryption provides the comprehensive data protection that your organization and customers demand. By placing the security controls on the data itself, the solution creates an envelope of protection around the data on Z. For example, Z pervasive encryption helps protect the at-rest and in-flight data that is on your Z infrastructure. Also, centralized, policy-based data encryption controls significantly reduce the costs that are associated with data security and regulatory compliance, including the new General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).
31;;ff2 fs3;;2
32;;ff2 fs0;;IBM Z pervasive encryption implements this comprehensive security with your ongoing operations in mind. Therefore, it does not require you to make any application changes, and can be implemented by using policy-based controls with low overhead. These capabilities can slash the costs associated with data security and compliance.
33;;ff1 fs5;;1.1.2  Transforming a transactional platform into a data powerhouse 
34;;ff2 fs0;;Currently, data is one of the most valuable resources an organization possesses. Deriving insights from that data to drive optimal business decisions becomes one of the biggest challenges. To maximize the value of that resource, your enterprise might need to integrate additional external data sources to extract hidden insights.
35;;ff2 fs0;;For decades, clients typically copied business-critical data from their mainframe transactional systems to other platforms, or even data lakes, to perform sophisticated analytics. This process was inefficient, expensive, time-consuming, and introduced both risk on lower-security platforms and data latency.
36;;ff2 fs0;;By accessing your enterprise data in-place with minimal data duplication or movement, you can minimize the cost and complexity of analytics. You can also make enterprise data highly accessible to analytics applications and tools by integrating transactional and analytics processing, and protect sensitive data by keeping it within the secure Z platform.

40;;ff2 fs0;;Because of the advanced infrastructure, with double the cache density on each chip and up to 32 TB memory, the z14 can support state-of-the-art cognitive solutions:
41;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Apache Spark: An open source, in-place analytics solution for z/OS that simplifies big data </ff2>
42;;ff2 fs0;;analysis. Apache Spark gives developers and data scientists the ability to analyze business-critical z/OS data in place, with no data movement. Apache Spark on z/OS can also provide a federated view by accessing and analyzing distributed and local data. 
43;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>IBM Machine Learning for z/OS: A comprehensive solution that manages the entire </ff2>
44;;ff2 fs0;;machine learning workflow, beginning with quick ingestion and transformation of Z data where it resides. The solution then securely creates, deploys, and manages high quality self-learning behavior models to help you extract hidden insights that more accurately anticipate organizational needs.
45;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>The IBM DB2® Analytics Accelerator for z/OS: A high-performance appliance that </ff2>
46;;ff2 fs0;;transforms your mainframe into a highly efficient transactional and analytics-processing environment. It supports the full lifecycle of a real-time analytics solution on a single system that integrates transactional data, historical data, and predictive analytics.
47;;ff1 fs5;;1.1.3  Getting more out of the platform with IT Operational Analytics
48;;ff2 fs0;;Today, demands for 24 x 7 high-performance operations continue to rise. At the same time, allowed service windows shrink and are much less frequent. Increasing system complexity makes planning, maintaining, and troubleshooting more difficult and time consuming. IT operations analytics represent a possible solution to this challenge.
49;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 provides the infrastructure to host real-time analytics tools so you can clearly see your operating environment, then maximize operational efficiencies to help reduce costs.
50;;ff2 fs0;;IBM designed IBM Operations Analytics for z (IOAz), IBM Common Data Provider for z, and IBM z Operational Insights to ensure that your Z operates at peak performance. To get the most out of your system, Operations Analytics for z provides deep insights based on IBM’s industry-leading expertise into your Z operational data.
51;;ff1 fs5;;1.1.4  Providing resilience with key to zero downtime 
52;;ff2 fs0;;Every second of downtime (planned or unplanned) can mean lost revenue. It is crucial to keep critical systems running 24 x 7, and to rapidly recover from an outage and resume critical business operations.
53;;ff2 fs0;;The 
54;;ff5 fs6;;Z<ff2 fs0> in IBM Z stands for zero downtime, and the z14 has the same proven reliability that all </ff2 fs0>
55;;ff2 fs0;;IBM Z platforms are known for. Like previous generations, the z14 provides technology and services to help identify and remove single points of failures (SPOFs) in critical components. Also, with platform-level redundancy, the z14 is designed to handle failures while maintaining user access. Components can be repaired, maintenance performed, and products migrated with minimal business impacts. Some capabilities, such as capacity-on-demand, automatically turn components on and off based on current needs.
56;;ff2 fs0;;Although the z14 platform is highly robust and even more so in a sysplex
57;;ff2 fs3;;3
58;;ff2 fs0;; environment, implementing the IBM Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex™ (IBM GDPS®) family of 
59;;ff1 fs0;;Note:<ff2> IBM z Advanced Workload Analysis Reporter (IBM zAware), which used to be </ff2>
60;;ff2 fs0;;delivered as a firmware appliance running on a dedicated LPAR, is now part of IOAz.
61;;ff2 fs4;;3  
62;;ff2 fs3;;Sysplex is a system clustering technique for high availability, see “High availability with Parallel Sysplex” on page 79 for details.
63;;ff2 fs1;;Chapter 1. The base of a trust economy  <ff1 fs0>5</ff1 fs0>
64;;ff2 fs0;;solutions improves resilience in cases of unplanned failures, power outages, fire, or human error. The GDPS family of solutions provides additional tools to ensure Z availability, and mask or significantly reduce the effects of critical component outages or failures. Using IBM HyperSwap® technology, I/O traffic can be seamlessly routed from disk subsystems that cannot service the I/O request to a second disk subsystem that can. Additionally, the GDPS/Active-Active solution can route workload from a server location that is experiencing problems to a second location that is operating well.
65;;ff1 fs5;;1.1.5  Accelerating digital transformation with agile service delivery
66;;ff2 fs0;;An effective DevOps solution breaks down existing development silos, unifies infrastructure platforms, and enables ongoing deliveries. z14 provides the scalable and secure infrastructure for enterprises that must rapidly create and deliver critical applications, while meeting agreed-on levels for quality, availability, regulatory compliance, and end-use expectations.
67;;ff2 fs0;;IBM DevOps for Z solutions operate from application understanding through deployment and management. In addition, DevOps for Z solutions gives you a single, cost-effective toolset to maintain and modernize valuable applications on both Z and distributed platforms.
68;;ff2 fs0;;For instance, Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence helps development teams understand application interdependencies, complexity, and quality across platforms, environments, and languages. This ability gives your teams an edge in identifying potential API candidates, and provides insight about maintainability and complexity. As a result, the candidate API quality rises, and the user experience improves as well.
69;;ff2 fs0;;In addition, the z14 provides the infrastructure to support the mission-critical workloads of cloud services. The new high-performance processors, large memory, and enhanced access to data enable the z14 to integrate business transactions, operational data, and analytics into a single workflow.
70;;ff2 fs0;;The IBM z14 is designed as a strategic asset to power the API economy.
71;;ff2 fs3;;4
72;;ff2 fs0;; Using the API economy demands fortified clouds, which can be open, private, public, and hybrid. The z14 gives you the hardware platform necessary to support those clouds.
73;;ff2 fs0;;For Linux assets, Z platforms are optimized for open source software, enhanced scalability, and sharing, while focusing on business continuity to support cloud. For traditional z/OS-based assets, Z offerings provide intuitive tools to help developers speed Representational State Transfer (RESTful) API development.
74;;ff2 fs0;;No matter which asset class you choose, the z14 allows mobile and cloud application developers to incorporate z/OS business-critical data and transactions into their applications without needing to understand z/OS subsystems.

78;;ff1 fs5;;1.1.6  Revolutionizing business processes
79;;ff2 fs0;;Blockchain is poised to revolutionize how industries do business. It is a technology for a new generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability, and transparency while streamlining business processes.
80;;ff2 fs0;;In a blockchain network, members have access to a distributed, shared ledger that is 
81;;ff5 fs6;;cryptographically<ff2 fs0> secure, updated by consensus, and becomes an immutable, indelible </ff2 fs0>
82;;ff2 fs0;;record of all 
83;;ff5 fs6;;transactions<ff2 fs0>. The ledger functions as a single source of “truth”. Considering that </ff2 fs0>
84;;ff2 fs0;;blockchain is all about increasing trust in 
85;;ff5 fs6;;business transactions<ff2 fs0>, it makes perfect sense to run </ff2 fs0>
86;;ff2 fs0;;blockchain for business on Z. Depending on your business or regulatory policies, you can choose on-premises installation supported by IBM-certified Docker images running on Linux on z Systems, or the IBM Blockchain on Bluemix® High Security Business Network (HSBN) service plan. HSBN is a fully managed blockchain service running in the IBM cloud. It delivers a secure, isolated compute environment that is ideally suited for workloads with sensitive data.
87;;ff1 fs5;;1.1.7  Blending open source and Z technologies
88;;ff2 fs0;;The right blend and balance of open source technologies, ISV tools, and IT platform is key to enable businesses and organizations to deliver change at a much quicker pace. To this end, IBM has created an ecosystem of clients, business partners, and ISVs who are engaging in an open source development community to bring the most important and most sought-after foundational open source technologies to its IT platforms. In addition, IBM is a member of many open-standard organizations and software governance consortia that help to shape the future of open source software. The combination of a robust and securable hardware platform with the power of a Linux distribution can optimize the building, testing, and deploying of modern applications, and can accommodate scale-out clusters and scalable clouds.
89;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 provides a secure, massive capacity Linux platform that can be deployed as stand-alone, or side-by-side with z/OS or IBM z/VSE® environments on a single physical platform. Therefore, you can easily integrate Linux workloads on the z14 with z/OS and z/VSE solutions that will benefit from data and applications being tightly collocated with fast internal communication and improved availability.
90;;ff2 fs0;;Linux on z Systems on the z14 uses pervasive encryption, which is a transparent protection envelope that secures data within the system. It gives you the performance and vertical scale that you need to meet the demands of your digital enterprise while controlling server sprawl costs. Combined with the integration benefits, Linux on z Systems on the z14 allows you to deploy innovative new services or cognitive analytics and consolidate x86 workloads.
91;;ff2 fs0;;In addition, deploying Linux on the z14 can benefit your bottom line. Compared to virtualized x86 alternatives and public cloud solutions, the lower costs for administration and management, software licensing, business continuity, and floor space can reduce your total cost of ownership.

157;;ff1 fs5;;1.2.2  Storage connectivity
158;;ff2 fs0;;Storage connectivity is provided on the z14 by IBM Fibre Connection (FICON) and the IBM zHyperLink Express feature. 
159;;ff1 fs7;;FICON
160;;ff2 fs0;;FICON features follow the established Fibre Channel (FC) standards to support data storage and access requirements, along with the latest FC technology in storage and access devices. FICON Express features support these protocols:
161;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Native FICON</ff2>
162;;ff2 fs0;;This enhanced protocol (over FC) provides for communication across channels, channel-to-channel (CTC) connectivity, and with FICON devices, such as disks, tapes, and printers. It is used in z/OS, IBM z/VM®, IBM z/VSE, z/TPF, and Linux on z Systems environments.
163;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP)</ff2>
164;;ff2 fs0;;This is a standard protocol for communicating with disk and tape devices through Fibre Channel switches and directors. The FCP channel can connect to FCP SAN fabrics and access FCP/SCSI devices. FCP is used by z/VM, KVM for IBM Z, z/VSE, and Linux on z Systems environments.
165;;ff2 fs0;;FICON Express16S+ features provide significant improvements in throughput and response time for performance-critical middleware, and to shrink the batch window that is required to accommodate I/O-bound batch work. FICON Express16S+ features are implemented using 
166;;ff1 fs0;;10<fs1>  <ff2>IBM z14 Technical Introduction</ff2></fs1>
167;;ff2 fs0;;PCIe cards, and offer better port granularity and improved capabilities over the previous FICON Express features. FICON Express16S+ features support a link data rate of 16 Gbps (4, 8, or 16 Gbps auto-negotiate), and is the preferred technology for new systems.
168;;ff2 fs0;;For more information about the available FICON Express features, see 3.1, “I/O features at a glance” on page 34.
169;;ff1 fs7;;zHyperLink Express
170;;ff2 fs0;;zHyperLink was created to provide fast access to data via extremely low latency connections between the Z platform and storage.
171;;ff2 fs0;;The zHyperLink Express feature allows you to make synchronous requests for data that is in the storage cache of the IBM DS8880. This process is done by directly connecting the zHyperLink Express port in the z14 to an I/O Bay port of the DS8880. This short distance (up to 150 m), direct connection is currently intended to speed up DB2 for z/OS 
172;;ff5 fs6;;blocking read<ff2 fs0> </ff2 fs0>
173;;ff2 fs0;;requests.
174;;ff2 fs0;;Working in conjunction with the FICON SAN Infrastructure, zHyperLink can improve application response time, cutting I/O-sensitive workload response time by up to 50% without requiring application changes. Note that zHyperLink channels complement FICON channels, but they do 
175;;ff5 fs6;;not<ff2 fs0> replace them.</ff2 fs0>
176;;ff1 fs5;;1.2.3  Network connectivity
177;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 is a fully virtualized platform that can support many system images at once. Therefore, network connectivity covers not only the connections between the platform and external networks with Open Systems Adapter-Express (OSA-Express) and 10 GbE RoCE Express features, but also supports specialized internal connections for intra-system communication through IBM HiperSockets™ and Shared Memory Communications–Direct Memory Access (SMC-D). 
178;;ff1 fs7;;OSA-Express
179;;ff2 fs0;;The OSA-Express features provide local area network (LAN) connectivity and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, OSA-Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the processor unit, allowing significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system.
180;;ff2 fs0;;OSA-Express6S features introduced with the z14 is a technology refresh. They continue to support 1000BASE-T Ethernet for copper environments as well as 10 Gigabit Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet fiber optic (single-mode and multimode) environments.
181;;ff1 fs7;;HiperSockets
182;;ff2 fs0;;IBM HiperSockets is an integrated function of the Z platforms that supplies attachments to up to 32 high-speed virtual local area networks with minimal system and network overhead.
183;;ff2 fs0;;HiperSockets is a function of the Licensed Internal Code (LIC). It provides LAN connectivity across multiple system images on the same Z platform by performing memory-to-memory data transfers in a secure way. The HiperSockets function eliminates the use of I/O subsystem operations and having to traverse an external network connection to communicate between logical partitions in the same Z platform. In this way, HiperSockets can help with server consolidation by connecting virtual servers and simplifying the enterprise network.
184;;ff2 fs1;;Chapter 1. The base of a trust economy  <ff1 fs0>11</ff1 fs0>
185;;ff1 fs7;;10GbE RoCE Express2
186;;ff2 fs0;;The 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) RoCE Express2 features uses Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) to provide fast memory-to-memory communications between two Z platforms or within a Z platform.
187;;ff2 fs0;;The feature is designed to help reduce consumption of CPU resources for applications that use the TCP/IP stack (such as IBM WebSphere® accessing an IBM DB2 database). It can also help reduce network latency with memory-to-memory transfers by using Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) in z/OS V2R1 or later.
188;;ff2 fs0;;With SMC-R, you can transfer huge amounts of data quickly, at low latency. SMC-R is completely transparent to the application, requiring no code changes and thus enabling rapid time to value.
189;;ff1 fs7;;SMC-D
190;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 also uses a recently introduced communications protocol called Shared Memory Communications
191;;ff2 fs7;; - <fs0>Direct Memory Access (SMC-D). SMC-D is similar to SMC-R, but is </fs0>
192;;ff2 fs0;;intended for communications<ff4> </ff4>
193;;ff5 fs6;;within<ff4 fs0> <ff2>the same Z platform, optimizing operating systems </ff2></ff4 fs0>
194;;ff2 fs0;;communications in a way that is transparent to socket applications. It reduces the CPU cost of TCP/IP processing in the data path, enabling highly efficient and application-transparent communications. Notably, SMC-D requires no additional physical resources (such as RoCE adapters, PCI bandwidth, ports, I/O slots, network resources, or 10GbE switches). Instead, SMC-D uses either HiperSockets or an OSA-Express feature for establishing the initial connection.
195;;ff2 fs0;;For more information about the available network connectivity features, see 3.1, “I/O features at a glance” on page 34.
196;;ff1 fs5;;1.2.4  Cryptography
197;;ff2 fs0;;z14 provides two major groups of cryptographic functions: CPACF and Crypto Express6S.
198;;ff2 fs0;;CPACF is a high performance, low latency co-processor that performs symmetric key encryption and calculates message digests (hashes) in hardware. Supported algorithms are AES, DES/TDES, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. Latency in the CPACF in the z14 is significantly less compared to the CPACF in the z13. The tamper-sensing and tamper-responding Crypto Express6S features provide acceleration for high-performance cryptographic operations and support up to 85 domains. This specialized hardware performs AES, DES/TDES, RSA, Elliptic Curve (ECC), SHA-1, and SHA-2, and other cryptographic operations. It supports specialized high-level cryptographic APIs and functions, including those required in the banking industry. Crypto Express6S features are designed to meet the FIPS 140-2 Level 4 and PCI HSM security requirements for hardware security modules. The z14 offers twice the AES performance as the z13, a True Random Number Generator, SHA3 support, and RSA/ECC acceleration.

285;;ff1 fs5;;1.3.1  IBM compilers
286;;ff2 fs0;;Compilers are built with specific knowledge of the system architecture, which is used during code generation. Therefore, using the latest compilers is essential to extract the maximum benefit of a platform’s capabilities. IBM compilers use the latest architecture enhancements and new instruction sets to deliver additional value.
287;;ff2 fs0;;With IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS and IBM Enterprise PL/I for z/OS, decades of IBM experience in application development can be used to integrate COBOL and PL/I with web services, XML, and Java. Such interoperability makes it possible to capitalize on existing IT investments, while smoothly incorporating new, web-based applications into the infrastructure.
288;;ff2 fs0;;z/OS, XL C/C++, and XL C/C++ for Linux on z Systems help with creating and maintaining critical business applications that are written in C or C++ to maximize application performance and improve developer productivity. These compilers transform C or C++ source code into executable code that fully leverages the Z architecture. This transformation is possible thanks to hardware-tailored optimizations, built-in functions, performance-tuned libraries, and language constructs that simplify system programming and boost application runtime performance.
289;;ff2 fs0;;Compilers such as COBOL, PL/I, and z/OS v2.3 XL C/C++ are inherently optimized on the IBM z14 because they use floating point registers rather than memory or fast mathematical computations. Using compilers that take advantage of hardware enhancements is key to improving application performance, reducing CPU usage, and lowering operating costs.
290;;ff2 fs0;;The IBM z14 also offers release-to-release improvements for Java. Combined with cryptography acceleration, the z14 can deliver improvements in throughput per core. The new z14 pause-less garbage collection capability provides improvements in throughput per core as well. Because of shorter, more consistent Java response times, the z14 achieves both improvements without significantly affecting overall throughput. So for Java applications that must remain highly responsive, enabling the new garbage collection mode is a good option.

302;;ff1 fs2;;2.1  Models and upgrade paths 
303;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 has an assigned machine type (MT) of 3906, which uniquely identifies the central processor complex (CPC). The z14 is offered in five models (M01, M02, M03, M04, and M05
304;;ff2 fs3;;1
305;;ff2 fs0;;). All z14 models use seven, eight, nine, or ten processor unit cores in five or six processor unit single chip modules in one CPC drawer. Spare processor units, system assist processors (SAPs), and one integrated firmware processor (IFP) are integral to the system and are present in all models of the z14.
306;;ff2 fs0;;Table 2-1 provides a summary that includes the number of characterizable processor units, SAPs, and spare processor units for the various models. For an explanation of processor unit characterization, see “PU characterization” on page 24.
307;;ff4 fs1;;Table 2-1   z14 model summary (machine type 3906)
308;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 offers 269 capacity levels. There are 170 capacity levels based on the number of physically used central processors (CPs), plus up to 99 additional subcapacity models for the first 33 CPs. There is also one model for all Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) or all Internal Coupling Facility (ICF) configurations.

322;;ff2 fs0;;Figure 2-1 depicts the upgrade paths to the z14.
323;;ff4 fs1;;Figure 2-1   z14 upgrade paths
324;;ff2 fs0;;On the z14, concurrent upgrades (explained in Chapter 4, “Strengths of the z14 platform” on page 59) are available for CPs, IFLs, ICFs, z Systems Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs), and SAPs. However, concurrent processor unit upgrades require that additional processor units are physically installed, but not activated at a previous time.
325;;ff2 fs0;;If an upgrade request cannot be accomplished in the existing configuration, a hardware upgrade is required in which one or more CPC drawers are added to accommodate the wanted capacity. On the z14, additional CPC drawers can be installed concurrently. However, upgrading from any z14 model to model M05 is disruptive because this upgrade is only supplied as a new system.
326;;ff2 fs0;;Spare processor units are used to replace defective processor units and there are always two spare processor units on a z14. In the rare event of a processor unit failure, one of the spare processor units is immediately and transparently activated and assigned the characteristics of the failing processor unit.
327;;ff1 fs2;;2.2  Frames and cabling
328;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 is always a two-frame system: The <ff5 fs6>A Frame <ff2 fs0>and the <ff5 fs6>Z Frame<ff2 fs0>. It can be delivered as </ff2 fs0></ff5 fs6></ff2 fs0></ff5 fs6>
329;;ff2 fs0;;an air-cooled system or as a water-cooled one. The two frames form the z14. The number of PCIe drawers can vary based on the number of I/O features. For a new build system, a combination of up to five PCIe I/O drawers can be installed. PCIe I/O drawers can be added concurrently.
330;;ff2 fs0;;In addition, the z14 (both new builds and MES orders) offers top-exit options for the fiber optic and copper cables used for I/O and power. These options (

341;;ff1 fs2;;2.3  CPC drawers
342;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 is a multiple CPC drawer system that can hold up to four drawers in the A Frame.
343;;ff2 fs0;;Each CPC drawer contains the following elements: 
344;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Single chip modules:</ff2>

350;;ff2 fs0;;– Either 15, 20, or 25 memory DIMMs are plugged in a CPC drawer.
351;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Fanouts:</ff2>
352;;ff2 fs0;;The CPC drawer provides up to 10 PCIe Gen3 fanout adapters to connect to the PCIe I/O drawers and ICA SR coupling links, and up to four InfiniBand fanout adapters for 12x InfiniBand and 1x InfiniBand coupling links.
353;;ff2 fs0;;Each fanout has one, two, or four ports: – One-port PCIe 16 GBps I/O fanout, each supporting one domain in 32-slot PCIe I/O drawers.
354;;ff2 fs0;;– ICA SR two-port PCIe fanout for coupling links (two links, 8 GBps each).

368;;ff4 fs1;;Figure 2-5   <fs0>z14</fs0> M05 CPC drawer structure 
369;;ff2 fs0;;For z14, two CPC drawer configurations are offered with 41 or 49 processor units. All the models employ CPC drawers with 41 processor units except for the model M05, which has four CPC drawers with 49 active processor units, for a total of 196 processor units (170 can be configured for use). Each storage control SCM includes 672 MB shared eDRAM cache, interface logic for up to six PU SCM each, and SMP fabric logic. The SC SMC is configured to provide a single 672 MB L4 cache that is shared by all PU cores in the CPC drawer. This amount of cache provides a total of 2.68 GB of cache if all four CPC drawers are implemented, yielding outstanding SMP scalability for real-world workloads.
370;;ff1 fs5;;2.3.2  Processor unit
371;;ff2 fs0;;Processor unit (PU) is the generic term for a IBM z/Architecture processor. Each PU is a superscalar processor with the following attributes:
372;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Up to six instructions can be decoded per clock cycle.</ff2>
373;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Up to ten instructions can be in execution per clock cycle.</ff2>
374;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Instructions can be issued out-of-order. The PU uses a high-frequency, low-latency </ff2>
375;;ff2 fs0;;pipeline, providing robust performance across a wide range of workloads.
376;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Memory accesses might not be in the same instruction order (out-of-order operand </ff2>

381;;ff1 fs7;;PU cache
382;;ff2 fs0;;The on-chip cache for the PU (core) works in this way:
383;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Each PU core has an L1 cache (pr8 KB cache for </ff2>
384;;ff2 fs0;;instructions and a 128 KB cache for data. 
385;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Each PU core has a private L2 cache, with 4 MB D-cache (“D” stands for data) and 2 MB </ff2>
386;;ff2 fs0;;I-cache (“I” stands for instruction). 
387;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Each PU SCM contains a 128 MB L3 cache that is shared by all PU cores in the SCM. The </ff2>
388;;ff2 fs0;;shared L3 cache uses eDRAM. This on-chip cache implementation optimizes system performance for high-frequency processors, with cache improvements, new Translation/TLB2 design, pipeline optimizations, and better branch prediction.
389;;ff1 fs7;;PU sparing
390;;ff2 fs0;;Hardware fault detection is embedded throughout the design, and is combined with comprehensive instruction-level retry and dynamic PU sparing. This function provides the reliability and availability that is required for true mainframe integrity.
391;;ff1 fs7;;On-chip cryptographic hardware
392;;ff2 fs0;;Dedicated on-chip cryptographic hardware for each PU core includes extended key and hash sizes for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), and support for UTF8 to UTF16 conversion. This cryptographic hardware is available with any processor type, for example CP, IBM zIIP, and IFL.
393;;ff1 fs7;;Software support
394;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 PUs provide full compatibility with existing software for z/Architecture, and extend the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to enable enhanced functionality and performance. Several hardware instructions that support more efficient code generation and execution are introduced in the z14:
395;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF)</ff2>
396;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Compression call (CMPSC) </ff2>
397;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Hardware decimal floating point (HDFP)</ff2>

399;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Runtime Instrumentation Facility </ff2>
400;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) </ff2>
401;;ff2 fs0;;These features are further described in Chapter 4, “Strengths of the z14 platform” on page 59.
402;;ff1 fs7;;PU characterization
403;;ff2 fs0;;PUs are ordered in single increments. The internal system functions, which are based on the configuration that is ordered, characterize each PU into one of various types during system initialization, which is often called a power-on reset (POR) operation. Characterizing PUs dynamically without a POR is possible by using a process called 
404;;ff5 fs6;;Dynamic Processor Unit Reassignment
405;;ff2 fs0;;. A PU that is not characterized cannot be used. Each PU can be characterized as follows:
406;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Central processor (CP)</ff2>
407;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) processor</ff2>
408;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>z Systems Integrated Information Processor (zIIP)</ff2>
409;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Internal Coupling Facility (ICF) </ff2>
410;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>System assist processor (SAP)</ff2>
411;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Integrated firmware processor (IFP)</ff2>
412;;ff2 fs1;;Chapter 2. IBM z14 hardware overview  <ff1 fs0>25</ff1 fs0>
413;;ff2 fs0;;At least one CP must be purchased with a zIIP or before a zIIP can be purchased. You can purchase up to two zIIPs for each purchased CP (assigned or unassigned) on the system. However, an LPAR definition can go beyond the 1:2 ratio. For example, on a system with two CPs, a maximum of four zIIPs can be installed. An LPAR definition for that system can contain up to two logical CPs and four logical zIIPs. Another possible configuration is one logical CP and three logical zIIPs.
414;;ff2 fs0;;Converting a PU from one type to any other type is possible by using the 
415;;ff5 fs6;;Dynamic Processor Unit Reassignment
416;;ff2 fs0;; process. These conversions happen concurrently with the operation of the system.
417;;ff1 fs5;;2.3.3  Memory
418;;ff2 fs0;;Maximum physical memory size is directly related to the number of CPC drawers in the system. Typically, a system has more memory installed than was ordered because part of the installed memory is used to implement the redundant array of independent memory (RAIM) design. On the z14, this configuration results in up to 8 TB of available memory per CPC drawer and up to 32 TB for a four-drawer system. The hardware system area (HSA) on the z14 has a fixed amount of memory (192 GB) that is managed separately from client memory. However, the maximum amount of orderable memory can vary from the theoretical number due to dependencies on the memory granularity.
419;;ff2 fs0;;Table 2-2 lists the maximum memory sizes for each z14 model.
420;;ff4 fs1;;Table 2-2   <fs0>z14</fs0> memory per model
421;;ff2 fs0;;On z14 systems, the granularity for memory orders is 64 - 512 GB. Table 2-3 shows the memory increments, depending on installed memory.

436;;ff1 fs0;;26<fs1>  <ff2>IBM z14 Technical Introduction</ff2></fs1>
437;;ff2 fs0;;Physically, memory is organized in these ways:
438;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>A CPC drawer always contains a minimum of 320 GB of installed memory, of which </ff2>
439;;ff2 fs0;;256 GB is usable by the operating system.
440;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>A CPC drawer can have more installed memory than is enabled. The excess memory can </ff2>
441;;ff2 fs0;;be enabled by a Licensed Internal Code load.
442;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Memory upgrades are first satisfied using already installed but unused memory capacity </ff2>
443;;ff2 fs0;;until it is exhausted. When no more unused memory is available from the installed cards, either the cards must be upgraded to a higher capacity, or a CPC drawer with more memory must be installed.
444;;ff2 fs0;;When an LPAR is activated, PR/SM tries to allocate processor units (PUs) and the memory of an LPAR in a single CPC drawer. However, if that is not possible, PR/SM will use memory resources located in any CPC drawer. For example, if the allocated PUs span more than one CPC drawer, PR/SM attempts to allocate memory across that same set of CPC drawers (even if all required memory is available in just one of those CPC drawers).
445;;ff2 fs0;;No matter which CPC drawer the memory is in, an LPAR has access to that memory after it is allocated. Despite the CPC drawer structure, the z14 is still an SMP system because the PUs have access to all the available memory.
446;;ff2 fs0;;A memory upgrade is considered to be concurrent when it requires no change of the physical memory cards. A memory card change is disruptive when no use is made of Enhanced Drawer Availability (EDA). In a multiple CPC drawer system, a single CPC drawer can be concurrently removed and reinstalled for a repair with EDA. For a description of EDA, see 
447;;ff4 fs0;;IBM z14 Technical Guide<ff2>, SG24-8451"fc0".</ff2>
448;;ff2 fs0;;For model upgrades involving the addition of a CPC drawer, the minimum usable memory increment (256 GB) is added to the system. During an upgrade, adding a CPC drawer is a concurrent operation, as is adding physical memory in the new drawer.
449;;ff1 fs7;;Concurrent memory upgrade
450;;ff2 fs0;;If physical memory is available, memory can be upgraded concurrently by using Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC), as described. The 
451;;ff5 fs6;;plan ahead memory function<ff2 fs0> </ff2 fs0>
452;;ff2 fs0;;that is available with the z14 enables nondisruptive memory upgrades by having in the system pre-plugged memory (based on a target configuration). Pre-plugged memory is enabled through an LICCC order that is placed by the client.
453;;ff1 fs7;;Redundant array of independent memory
454;;ff2 fs0;;RAIM technology makes the memory subsystem, in essence, a fully fault-tolerant N+1 design. The RAIM design automatically detects and recovers from failures of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), sockets, memory channels, or dual inline memory modules (DIMMs). The RAIM design is fully integrated in the z14, and has been enhanced to include one Memory Controller Unit (MCU) per processor chip, with five memory channels and one DIMM per channel. A fifth channel in each MCU enables memory to be implemented as RAIM. This technology has significant reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) capabilities in the area of error correction. Bit, lane, DRAM, DIMM, socket, and complete memory channel failures, including many types of multiple failures, can be detected and corrected.

459;;ff1 fs5;;2.3.4  Hardware system area
460;;ff2 fs0;;The HSA is a fixed-size, reserved area of memory that is separate from the client-purchased memory. The HSA is used for several internal functions, but the bulk of it is used by channel subsystem functions. The fixed-size 192 GB HSA for z14 is large enough to accommodate any LPAR definitions or changes, thus eliminating most outage situations and the need for extensive preplanning.
461;;ff2 fs0;;A fixed, large HSA allows the dynamic I/O capability of the z14 to be enabled by default. It also enables the dynamic addition and removal of the following features:
462;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>LPAR to new or existing channel subsystem (CSS)</ff2>
463;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>CSS (up to six can be defined in z14)</ff2>

468;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 supports the following type of internal I/O infrastructure:
469;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Generation 3 PCIe-based infrastructure for PCIe I/O drawers (PCIe Gen3)</ff2>

481;;ff4 fs1;;Figure 2-6   <fs0>z14</fs0> I/O system structure
482;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 supports four fanout types (for fanout location, see Figure 2-7 on page 29), which are at the front of the CPC drawer: 
483;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>ICA SR</ff2>
484;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>HCA3-O (z14 is the last Z platform to support this feature)</ff2>
485;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>HCA3-O LR (z14 is the last Z platform to support this feature)</ff2>
486;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>PCIe Gen3</ff2>
487;;ff2 fs0;;The HCA3-O LR fanout includes four ports. The PCIe Gen3 fanout has one port, and the other fanouts have two ports.
488;;ff2 fs0;;The following types of internal I/O connectivity support the PCIe I/O drawer:
489;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>PCIe connections to the PCIe I/O drawers.</ff2>
490;;ff2 fs0;;For coupling link connectivity (Parallel Sysplex and STP configuration), the z14 supports the following link types:
491;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>ICA SR</ff2>
492;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>12x InfiniBand coupling link</ff2>
493;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>1x InfiniBand coupling link</ff2>
494;;ff3 fs0;;� <ff2>Coupling Express LR</ff2>
495;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 CPC drawer (Figure 2-7 on page 29) can have up to 10 1-port PCIe Gen3 or 2-port ICA PCIe coupling fanouts (numbered LG03 to LG12) and up to four 2-port or 4-port InfiniBand coupling fanouts for each CPC drawer (numbered LG13 to LG16). All coupling fanouts support Parallel Sysplex connectivity.
496;;ff2 fs0;;For systems with multiple CPC drawers, the locations of the PCIe Gen3 fanouts are configured and plugged across all drawers installed for maximum availability. This configuration helps ensure that alternate paths maintain access to critical I/O devices, such as disks and networks.

498;;ff4 fs1;;Figure 2-7   z14 CPC drawer, front view
499;;ff2 fs0;;The PCIe I/O drawer (see Figure 2-8) is a two-sided drawer that is 7U high. I/O features can be installed in both sides. The drawer contains 32 slots, four switch cards (two in the front and two in the rear). These features support four I/O domains that each contain eight features of any type (FICON Express16S+, FICON Express16S, FICON Express8S, OSA-Express6S, OSA-Express5S, OSA-Express4S, Crypto Express6S, Crypto Express5S, zEDC Express, 10GbE RoCE Express, 10GbE RoCE Express2, zHyperLink Express, and Coupling Express  LR). Two DCAs provide redundant power, and two air moving devices (AMDs) provide redundant cooling to the PCIe I/O Drawer.

501;;ff2 fs0;;More details about the supported I/O features of the z14 are available in Chapter 3, “Supported features and functions” on page 33.
502;;ff1 fs2;;2.5  Power and cooling
503;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 meets the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Class A3 specifications. "fc1"ASHRAE is an organization that is devoted to the advancement of indoor-environment-control technology in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning industry.
504;;ff1 fs0;;30<fs1>  <ff2>IBM z14 Technical Introduction</ff2></fs1>
505;;ff2 fs0;;The power and cooling system of the z14 builds on that of its predecessor, the IBM z13, with several newly developed technologies. However, the underlying power service specifications of the z14 are almost identical to its predecessors. Total power consumption with the maximum system configuration has increased only by about 5% compared to those previous models.
506;;ff2 fs0;;A closed, internal water cooling loop is used to cool single chip modules in the CPC drawers of the z14. Extracting the heat from the internal water loop can be done either with a radiator (air-cooled system) or a water cooling unit (water-cooled system). Conversion from air to water cooled systems, and vice versa, is not available.
507;;ff1 fs5;;2.5.1  Radiator (air) cooling option
508;;ff2 fs0;;The cooling system in the z14 is redesigned for better availability and lower cooling power consumption. The radiator design is a closed-loop water cooling pump system for the single chip modules in the CPC drawers. It is designed with N+1 pumps, blowers, controls, and sensors. The radiator unit is cooled by air.
509;;ff1 fs5;;2.5.2  Water cooling option
510;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 continues to offer the choice of using a building’s chilled water to cool the system by employing water cooling unit (WCU) technology. The single chip modules in the CPC drawer are cooled by an internal, closed, water cooling loop. In the internal closed loop, water exchanges heat with building-chilled water (provided by the client) through a cold plate.
511;;ff2 fs0;;In addition to the single chip modules, the internal water loop also circulates through two heat exchangers that are in the path of the exhaust air in the rear of the frames. These heat exchangers remove approximately 60-65% of the residual heat from the I/O drawers.
512;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 operates with two fully redundant WCUs. One WCU can support the entire load, and replacement of a WCU is fully concurrent. During a total loss of building-chilled water or if both water cooling units fail, the rear door heat exchangers cool the internal water cooling loop.
513;;ff1 fs5;;2.5.3  High Voltage Direct Current power feature
514;;ff2 fs0;;With the optional High Voltage Direct Current (HV DC) power feature, the z14 can directly connect to DC power input and improve data center energy efficiency by removing the need for an extra DC-to-AC inversion step. This feature can help achieve both data center UPS and power distribution energy savings.
515;;ff1 fs5;;2.5.4  Power considerations
516;;ff2 fs0;;The z14 operates with two sets of redundant power supplies. Each set has i
517;;ff2 fs0;;power cords or pair of power cords, depending on the number of Bulk Power Regulator (BPR) pairs installed. Power cords attach a 3-phase, 50/60 Hz, 200 - 480 V AC power source or 380 - 520 V DC power source. The loss of just one power supply has no effect on system operation.
518;;ff2 fs1;;Chapter 2. IBM z14 hardware overview  <ff1 fs0>31</ff1 fs0>
519;;ff2 fs0;;The optional Balanced Power Plan Ahead feature is available for future growth, also assuring adequate and balanced power for all possible configurations. With this feature, downtime for upgrading a system is eliminated because the initial installation includes the maximum power requirements in terms of BPRs and power cords. The Balance Power Plan Ahead feature is not available with DC and 1-phase power cords.
520;;ff2 fs0;;Additional single-phase outlets (customer provided) are required for ancillary equipment such as the Hardware Management Console and its display.
521;;ff2 fs0;;Specific power requirements depend on the cooling facility that is installed, the number of CPC drawers, and the number and type of I/O units that are installed. You can find maximum power consumption tables for the various configurations and environments in 
522;;ff4 fs0;;IBM 3906 Installation Manual for Physical Planning<ff2>, GC28-6965"fc0".</ff2>
