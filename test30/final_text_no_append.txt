ff1 fs2
1.1  The z14: A secure platform integrated and open by design
ff2 fs0
The z14 introduces a paradigm shift for protecting data and transactions, from selective 
ff2 fs0
encryption to pervasive encryption.
ff2 fs3

ff2 fs0
 It includes higher-performance processors and 
ff2 fs0
co-processors, increased cache density, up to 32 TB of memory, enhanced access to data, 
ff2 fs0
improved virtualization for running Linux on z Systems, and enhancements for Java and other 
ff2 fs0
compilers.
ff2 fs0
The z14 offers a fast, scalable, and securable enterprise system. Compared to its 
ff2 fs0
predecessor platforms, the z14 provides more of what you need to satisfy today’s growing IT 
ff2 fs0
demands:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Compute power for increased throughput</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Large-scale memory to process data faster</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Industry-unique cache design to optimize performance</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Accelerated I/O bandwidth to process massive amounts of data</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Data compression to economically store and process information</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>High-speed cryptographic operations to help secure transactions and data</ff2>
ff2 fs0
From the hundreds of microprocessors to the software stack, the z14 is built to quickly 
ff2 fs0
respond to change. This evolution of the Z platform embodies a proven infrastructure 
ff2 fs0
designed from the ground up for data and transactions. Figure 1-1 shows the z14.

ff1 fs5
1.1.1  Securing data with pervasive encryption
ff2 fs0
The z14 excels with security features that are built into the hardware, firmware, and operating 
ff2 fs0
systems. The built-in features range from storage protection keys and workload isolation to 
ff2 fs0
granular audit capabilities, and more. The Central Processor Assist for Cryptographic 
ff2 fs0
Function (CPACF), standard on every core, supports pervasive encryption and provides 
ff2 fs0
hardware acceleration for encryption operations. In addition, the new Crypto Express6S gets 
ff2 fs0
a performance boost on z14. Combined, these two enhancements perform encryption more 
ff2 fs0
efficiently on the z14 than on earlier Z platforms.
ff2 fs0
IBM Z pervasive encryption provides the comprehensive data protection that your 
ff2 fs0
organization and customers demand. By placing the security controls on the data itself, the 
ff2 fs0
solution creates an envelope of protection around the data on Z. For example, Z pervasive 
ff2 fs0
encryption helps protect the at-rest and in-flight data that is on your Z infrastructure. Also, 
ff2 fs0
centralized, policy-based data encryption controls significantly reduce the costs that are 
ff2 fs0
associated with data security and regulatory compliance, including the new General Data 
ff2 fs0
Protection Regulations (GDPR).
ff2 fs3
2
ff2 fs0
IBM Z pervasive encryption implements this comprehensive security with your ongoing 
ff2 fs0
operations in mind. Therefore, it does not require you to make any application changes, and 
ff2 fs0
can be implemented by using policy-based controls with low overhead. These capabilities can 
ff2 fs0
slash the costs associated with data security and compliance.
ff1 fs5
1.1.2  Transforming a transactional platform into a data powerhouse 
ff2 fs0
Currently, data is one of the most valuable resources an organization possesses. Deriving 
ff2 fs0
insights from that data to drive optimal business decisions becomes one of the biggest 
ff2 fs0
challenges. To maximize the value of that resource, your enterprise might need to integrate 
ff2 fs0
additional external data sources to extract hidden insights.
ff2 fs0
For decades, clients typically copied business-critical data from their mainframe transactional 
ff2 fs0
systems to other platforms, or even data lakes, to perform sophisticated analytics. This 
ff2 fs0
process was inefficient, expensive, time-consuming, and introduced both risk on 
ff2 fs0
lower-security platforms and data latency.
ff2 fs0
By accessing your enterprise data in-place with minimal data duplication or movement, you 
ff2 fs0
can minimize the cost and complexity of analytics. You can also make enterprise data highly 
ff2 fs0
accessible to analytics applications and tools by integrating transactional and analytics 
ff2 fs0
processing, and protect sensitive data by keeping it within the secure Z platform.

ff2 fs0
Because of the advanced infrastructure, with double the cache density on each chip and up to 
ff2 fs0
32 TB memory, the z14 can support state-of-the-art cognitive solutions:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Apache Spark: An open source, in-place analytics solution for z/OS that simplifies big data </ff2>
ff2 fs0
analysis. Apache Spark gives developers and data scientists the ability to analyze 
ff2 fs0
business-critical z/OS data in place, with no data movement. Apache Spark on z/OS can 
ff2 fs0
also provide a federated view by accessing and analyzing distributed and local data. 
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>IBM Machine Learning for z/OS: A comprehensive solution that manages the entire </ff2>
ff2 fs0
machine learning workflow, beginning with quick ingestion and transformation of Z data 
ff2 fs0
where it resides. The solution then securely creates, deploys, and manages high quality 
ff2 fs0
self-learning behavior models to help you extract hidden insights that more accurately 
ff2 fs0
anticipate organizational needs.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>The IBM DB2® Analytics Accelerator for z/OS: A high-performance appliance that </ff2>
ff2 fs0
transforms your mainframe into a highly efficient transactional and analytics-processing 
ff2 fs0
environment. It supports the full lifecycle of a real-time analytics solution on a single 
ff2 fs0
system that integrates transactional data, historical data, and predictive analytics.
ff1 fs5
1.1.3  Getting more out of the platform with IT Operational Analytics
ff2 fs0
Today, demands for 24 x 7 high-performance operations continue to rise. At the same time, 
ff2 fs0
allowed service windows shrink and are much less frequent. Increasing system complexity 
ff2 fs0
makes planning, maintaining, and troubleshooting more difficult and time consuming. IT 
ff2 fs0
operations analytics represent a possible solution to this challenge.
ff2 fs0
The z14 provides the infrastructure to host real-time analytics tools so you can clearly see 
ff2 fs0
your operating environment, then maximize operational efficiencies to help reduce costs.
ff2 fs0
IBM designed IBM Operations Analytics for z (IOAz), IBM Common Data Provider for z, and 
ff2 fs0
IBM z Operational Insights to ensure that your Z operates at peak performance. To get the 
ff2 fs0
most out of your system, Operations Analytics for z provides deep insights based on IBM’s 
ff2 fs0
industry-leading expertise into your Z operational data.
ff1 fs5
1.1.4  Providing resilience with key to zero downtime 
ff2 fs0
Every second of downtime (planned or unplanned) can mean lost revenue. It is crucial to 
ff2 fs0
keep critical systems running 24 x 7, and to rapidly recover from an outage and resume 
ff2 fs0
critical business operations.
ff2 fs0
The 
ff5 fs6
Z<ff2 fs0> in IBM Z stands for zero downtime, and the z14 has the same proven reliability that all </ff2 fs0>
ff2 fs0
IBM Z platforms are known for. Like previous generations, the z14 provides technology and 
ff2 fs0
services to help identify and remove single points of failures (SPOFs) in critical components. 
ff2 fs0
Also, with platform-level redundancy, the z14 is designed to handle failures while maintaining 
ff2 fs0
user access. Components can be repaired, maintenance performed, and products migrated 
ff2 fs0
with minimal business impacts. Some capabilities, such as capacity-on-demand, 
ff2 fs0
automatically turn components on and off based on current needs.
ff2 fs0
Although the z14 platform is highly robust and even more so in a sysplex
ff2 fs3
3
ff2 fs0
 environment, 
ff2 fs0
implementing the IBM Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex™ (IBM GDPS®) family of 
ff1 fs0
Note:<ff2> IBM z Advanced Workload Analysis Reporter (IBM zAware), which used to be </ff2>
ff2 fs0
delivered as a firmware appliance running on a dedicated LPAR, is now part of IOAz.

ff2 fs3
Sysplex is a system clustering technique for high availability, see “High availability with Parallel Sysplex” on page 79 
ff2 fs3
for details.
ff2 fs1
Chapter 1. The base of a trust economy  <ff1 fs0>5</ff1 fs0>
ff2 fs0
solutions improves resilience in cases of unplanned failures, power outages, fire, or human 
ff2 fs0
error. The GDPS family of solutions provides additional tools to ensure Z availability, and 
ff2 fs0
mask or significantly reduce the effects of critical component outages or failures. 
ff2 fs0
Using IBM HyperSwap® technology, I/O traffic can be seamlessly routed from disk 
ff2 fs0
subsystems that cannot service the I/O request to a second disk subsystem that can. 
ff2 fs0
Additionally, the GDPS/Active-Active solution can route workload from a server location that is 
ff2 fs0
experiencing problems to a second location that is operating well.
ff1 fs5
1.1.5  Accelerating digital transformation with agile service delivery
ff2 fs0
An effective DevOps solution breaks down existing development silos, unifies infrastructure 
ff2 fs0
platforms, and enables ongoing deliveries. z14 provides the scalable and secure 
ff2 fs0
infrastructure for enterprises that must rapidly create and deliver critical applications, while 
ff2 fs0
meeting agreed-on levels for quality, availability, regulatory compliance, and end-use 
ff2 fs0
expectations.
ff2 fs0
IBM DevOps for Z solutions operate from application understanding through deployment and 
ff2 fs0
management. In addition, DevOps for Z solutions gives you a single, cost-effective toolset to 
ff2 fs0
maintain and modernize valuable applications on both Z and distributed platforms.
ff2 fs0
For instance, Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence helps development teams 
ff2 fs0
understand application interdependencies, complexity, and quality across platforms, 
ff2 fs0
environments, and languages. This ability gives your teams an edge in identifying potential 
ff2 fs0
API candidates, and provides insight about maintainability and complexity. As a result, the 
ff2 fs0
candidate API quality rises, and the user experience improves as well.
ff2 fs0
In addition, the z14 provides the infrastructure to support the mission-critical workloads of 
ff2 fs0
cloud services. The new high-performance processors, large memory, and enhanced access 
ff2 fs0
to data enable the z14 to integrate business transactions, operational data, and analytics into 
ff2 fs0
a single workflow.
ff2 fs0
The IBM z14 is designed as a strategic asset to power the API economy.
ff2 fs3
4
ff2 fs0
 Using the API 
ff2 fs0
economy demands fortified clouds, which can be open, private, public, and hybrid. The z14 
ff2 fs0
gives you the hardware platform necessary to support those clouds.
ff2 fs0
For Linux assets, Z platforms are optimized for open source software, enhanced scalability, 
ff2 fs0
and sharing, while focusing on business continuity to support cloud. For traditional 
ff2 fs0
z/OS-based assets, Z offerings provide intuitive tools to help developers speed 
ff2 fs0
Representational State Transfer (RESTful) API development.
ff2 fs0
No matter which asset class you choose, the z14 allows mobile and cloud application 
ff2 fs0
developers to incorporate z/OS business-critical data and transactions into their applications 
ff2 fs0
without needing to understand z/OS subsystems.

1.1.6  Revolutionizing business processes
ff2 fs0
Blockchain is poised to revolutionize how industries do business. It is a technology for a new 
ff2 fs0
generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability, and 
ff2 fs0
transparency while streamlining business processes.
ff2 fs0
In a blockchain network, members have access to a distributed, shared ledger that is 
ff5 fs6
cryptographically<ff2 fs0> secure, updated by consensus, and becomes an immutable, indelible </ff2 fs0>
ff2 fs0
record of all 
ff5 fs6
transactions<ff2 fs0>. The ledger functions as a single source of “truth”. Considering that </ff2 fs0>
ff2 fs0
blockchain is all about increasing trust in 
ff5 fs6
business transactions<ff2 fs0>, it makes perfect sense to run </ff2 fs0>
ff2 fs0
blockchain for business on Z. 
ff2 fs0
Depending on your business or regulatory policies, you can choose on-premises installation 
ff2 fs0
supported by IBM-certified Docker images running on Linux on z Systems, or the IBM 
ff2 fs0
Blockchain on Bluemix® High Security Business Network (HSBN) service plan. HSBN is a 
ff2 fs0
fully managed blockchain service running in the IBM cloud. It delivers a secure, isolated 
ff2 fs0
compute environment that is ideally suited for workloads with sensitive data.
ff1 fs5
1.1.7  Blending open source and Z technologies
ff2 fs0
The right blend and balance of open source technologies, ISV tools, and IT platform is key to 
ff2 fs0
enable businesses and organizations to deliver change at a much quicker pace. To this end, 
ff2 fs0
IBM has created an ecosystem of clients, business partners, and ISVs who are engaging in 
ff2 fs0
an open source development community to bring the most important and most sought-after 
ff2 fs0
foundational open source technologies to its IT platforms. In addition, IBM is a member of 
ff2 fs0
many open-standard organizations and software governance consortia that help to shape the 
ff2 fs0
future of open source software. 
ff2 fs0
The combination of a robust and securable hardware platform with the power of a Linux 
ff2 fs0
distribution can optimize the building, testing, and deploying of modern applications, and can 
ff2 fs0
accommodate scale-out clusters and scalable clouds.
ff2 fs0
The z14 provides a secure, massive capacity Linux platform that can be deployed as 
ff2 fs0
stand-alone, or side-by-side with z/OS or IBM z/VSE® environments on a single physical 
ff2 fs0
platform. Therefore, you can easily integrate Linux workloads on the z14 with z/OS and z/VSE 
ff2 fs0
solutions that will benefit from data and applications being tightly collocated with fast internal 
ff2 fs0
communication and improved availability.
ff2 fs0
Linux on z Systems on the z14 uses pervasive encryption, which is a transparent protection 
ff2 fs0
envelope that secures data within the system. It gives you the performance and vertical scale 
ff2 fs0
that you need to meet the demands of your digital enterprise while controlling server sprawl 
ff2 fs0
costs. Combined with the integration benefits, Linux on z Systems on the z14 allows you to 
ff2 fs0
deploy innovative new services or cognitive analytics and consolidate x86 workloads.
ff2 fs0
In addition, deploying Linux on the z14 can benefit your bottom line. Compared to virtualized 
ff2 fs0
x86 alternatives and public cloud solutions, the lower costs for administration and 
ff2 fs0
management, software licensing, business continuity, and floor space can reduce your total 
ff2 fs0
cost of ownership.

1.2.2  Storage connectivity
ff2 fs0
Storage connectivity is provided on the z14 by IBM Fibre Connection (FICON) and the 
ff2 fs0
IBM zHyperLink Express feature. 
ff1 fs7
FICON
ff2 fs0
FICON features follow the established Fibre Channel (FC) standards to support data storage 
ff2 fs0
and access requirements, along with the latest FC technology in storage and access devices. 
ff2 fs0
FICON Express features support these protocols:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Native FICON</ff2>
ff2 fs0
This enhanced protocol (over FC) provides for communication across channels, 
ff2 fs0
channel-to-channel (CTC) connectivity, and with FICON devices, such as disks, tapes, 
ff2 fs0
and printers. It is used in z/OS, IBM z/VM®, IBM z/VSE, z/TPF, and Linux on z Systems 
ff2 fs0
environments.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP)</ff2>
ff2 fs0
This is a standard protocol for communicating with disk and tape devices through Fibre 
ff2 fs0
Channel switches and directors. The FCP channel can connect to FCP SAN fabrics and 
ff2 fs0
access FCP/SCSI devices. FCP is used by z/VM, KVM for IBM Z, z/VSE, and Linux on z 
ff2 fs0
Systems environments.
ff2 fs0
FICON Express16S+ features provide significant improvements in throughput and response 
ff2 fs0
time for performance-critical middleware, and to shrink the batch window that is required to 
ff2 fs0
accommodate I/O-bound batch work. FICON Express16S+ features are implemented using 
ff1 fs0
10<fs1>  <ff2>IBM z14 Technical Introduction</ff2></fs1>
ff2 fs0
PCIe cards, and offer better port granularity and improved capabilities over the previous 
ff2 fs0
FICON Express features. FICON Express16S+ features support a link data rate of 16 Gbps 
ff2 fs0
(4, 8, or 16 Gbps auto-negotiate), and is the preferred technology for new systems.
ff2 fs0
For more information about the available FICON Express features, see 3.1, “I/O features at a 
ff2 fs0
glance” on page 34.
ff1 fs7
zHyperLink Express
ff2 fs0
zHyperLink was created to provide fast access to data via extremely low latency connections 
ff2 fs0
between the Z platform and storage.
ff2 fs0
The zHyperLink Express feature allows you to make synchronous requests for data that is in 
ff2 fs0
the storage cache of the IBM DS8880. This process is done by directly connecting the 
ff2 fs0
zHyperLink Express port in the z14 to an I/O Bay port of the DS8880. This short distance (up 
ff2 fs0
to 150 m), direct connection is currently intended to speed up DB2 for z/OS 
ff5 fs6
blocking read<ff2 fs0> </ff2 fs0>
ff2 fs0
requests.
ff2 fs0
Working in conjunction with the FICON SAN Infrastructure, zHyperLink can improve 
ff2 fs0
application response time, cutting I/O-sensitive workload response time by up to 50% without 
ff2 fs0
requiring application changes. 
ff2 fs0
Note that zHyperLink channels complement FICON channels, but they do 
ff5 fs6
not<ff2 fs0> replace them.</ff2 fs0>
ff1 fs5
1.2.3  Network connectivity
ff2 fs0
The z14 is a fully virtualized platform that can support many system images at once. 
ff2 fs0
Therefore, network connectivity covers not only the connections between the platform and 
ff2 fs0
external networks with Open Systems Adapter-Express (OSA-Express) and 10 GbE RoCE 
ff2 fs0
Express features, but also supports specialized internal connections for intra-system 
ff2 fs0
communication through IBM HiperSockets™ and Shared Memory Communications–Direct 
ff2 fs0
Memory Access (SMC-D). 
ff1 fs7
OSA-Express
ff2 fs0
The OSA-Express features provide local area network (LAN) connectivity and comply with 
ff2 fs0
IEEE standards. In addition, OSA-Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP 
ff2 fs0
stack that normally are performed by the processor unit, allowing significant performance 
ff2 fs0
benefits by offloading processing from the operating system.
ff2 fs0
OSA-Express6S features introduced with the z14 is a technology refresh. They continue to 
ff2 fs0
support 1000BASE-T Ethernet for copper environments as well as 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 
ff2 fs0
Gigabit Ethernet fiber optic (single-mode and multimode) environments.

HiperSockets
ff2 fs0
IBM HiperSockets is an integrated function of the Z platforms that supplies attachments to up 
ff2 fs0
to 32 high-speed virtual local area networks with minimal system and network overhead.
ff2 fs0
HiperSockets is a function of the Licensed Internal Code (LIC). It provides LAN connectivity 
ff2 fs0
across multiple system images on the same Z platform by performing memory-to-memory 
ff2 fs0
data transfers in a secure way. The HiperSockets function eliminates the use of I/O 
ff2 fs0
subsystem operations and having to traverse an external network connection to communicate 
ff2 fs0
between logical partitions in the same Z platform. In this way, HiperSockets can help with 
ff2 fs0
server consolidation by connecting virtual servers and simplifying the enterprise network.

10GbE RoCE Express2
ff2 fs0
The 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) RoCE Express2 features uses Remote Direct Memory 
ff2 fs0
Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) to provide fast memory-to-memory 
ff2 fs0
communications between two Z platforms or within a Z platform.
ff2 fs0
The feature is designed to help reduce consumption of CPU resources for applications that 
ff2 fs0
use the TCP/IP stack (such as IBM WebSphere® accessing an IBM DB2 database). It can 
ff2 fs0
also help reduce network latency with memory-to-memory transfers by using Shared Memory 
ff2 fs0
Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) in z/OS V2R1 or later.
ff2 fs0
With SMC-R, you can transfer huge amounts of data quickly, at low latency. SMC-R is 
ff2 fs0
completely transparent to the application, requiring no code changes and thus enabling rapid 
ff2 fs0
time to value.
ff1 fs7
SMC-D
ff2 fs0
The z14 also uses a recently introduced communications protocol called Shared Memory 
ff2 fs0
Communications
ff2 fs7
 - <fs0>Direct Memory Access (SMC-D). SMC-D is similar to SMC-R, but is </fs0>
ff2 fs0
intended for communications<ff4> </ff4>
ff5 fs6
within<ff4 fs0> <ff2>the same Z platform, optimizing operating systems </ff2></ff4 fs0>
ff2 fs0
communications in a way that is transparent to socket applications. It reduces the CPU cost of 
ff2 fs0
TCP/IP processing in the data path, enabling highly efficient and application-transparent 
ff2 fs0
communications. Notably, SMC-D requires no additional physical resources (such as RoCE 
ff2 fs0
adapters, PCI bandwidth, ports, I/O slots, network resources, or 10GbE switches). Instead, 
ff2 fs0
SMC-D uses either HiperSockets or an OSA-Express feature for establishing the initial 
ff2 fs0
connection.

1.2.4  Cryptography
ff2 fs0
z14 provides two major groups of cryptographic functions: CPACF and Crypto Express6S.
ff2 fs0
CPACF is a high performance, low latency co-processor that performs symmetric key 
ff2 fs0
encryption and calculates message digests (hashes) in hardware. Supported algorithms are 
ff2 fs0
AES, DES/TDES, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. Latency in the CPACF in the z14 is significantly 
ff2 fs0
less compared to the CPACF in the z13. 
ff2 fs0
The tamper-sensing and tamper-responding Crypto Express6S features provide acceleration 
ff2 fs0
for high-performance cryptographic operations and support up to 85 domains. This 
ff2 fs0
specialized hardware performs AES, DES/TDES, RSA, Elliptic Curve (ECC), SHA-1, and 
ff2 fs0
SHA-2, and other cryptographic operations. It supports specialized high-level cryptographic 
ff2 fs0
APIs and functions, including those required in the banking industry. Crypto Express6S 
ff2 fs0
features are designed to meet the FIPS 140-2 Level 4 and PCI HSM security requirements for 
ff2 fs0
hardware security modules. 
ff2 fs0
The z14 offers twice the AES performance as the z13, a True Random Number Generator, 
ff2 fs0
SHA3 support, and RSA/ECC acceleration.
ff1 fs5
1.2.5  Clustering connectivity
ff2 fs0
A Parallel Sysplex is an IBM Z clustering technology used to make applications running on 
ff2 fs0

ff2 fs0
digital services, agile application development, connectivity, and systems management. This 
ff2 fs0
configuration creates an integrated, platform with specialized hardware and dedicated 
ff2 fs0
computing capabilities.
ff2 fs0
The z14 delivers a range of features and functions, allowing processor units to concentrate on 
ff2 fs0

environments.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Guarded Storage Facility (GSF)</ff2>
ff2 fs0
Also known as pause-less garbage collection, Guarded Storage Facility is a new 
ff2 fs0
architecture introduced with z14 to enable enterprise scale Java applications to run 
ff2 fs0
without periodic pause for garbage collection on larger heaps.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Instruction Execution Protection Facility (IEPF)</ff2>
ff2 fs0
Instruction Execution Protection is a new hardware function introduced with z14 that 
ff2 fs0
enables software like IBM Language Environment® to mark certain memory regions (for 
ff2 fs0
example, a heap or stack) as non-executable to improve the security of programs running 
ff2 fs0
on Z against stack-overflow or similar attacks.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT)</ff2>
ff2 fs0
With SMT, you can process up to two simultaneous threads in a single core to optimize 
ff2 fs0
throughput. An operating system with SMT support can be configured to dispatch work to 
ff2 fs0

ff1 fs5
1.2.7  Capacity on demand and performance
ff2 fs0
The z14 enables just-in-time deployment of processor resources. The capacity on demand 
ff2 fs0
(CoD) function allows users to dynamically change available system capacity. This function 
ff2 fs0
helps companies respond to new business requirements with flexibility and precise 
ff2 fs0
granularity. 
ff2 fs0
Also contributing to the additional capacity on the z14 are numerous improvements in 
ff2 fs0
processor chip design, including new instructions, multithreading, and redesigned and larger 
ff2 fs0
caches.
ff2 fs0
In the same footprint, the z14 can deliver up to 25%
ff2 fs3

1.3.1  IBM compilers
ff2 fs0
Compilers are built with specific knowledge of the system architecture, which is used during 
ff2 fs0
code generation. Therefore, using the latest compilers is essential to extract the maximum 
ff2 fs0
benefit of a platform’s capabilities. IBM compilers use the latest architecture enhancements 
ff2 fs0
and new instruction sets to deliver additional value.
ff2 fs0
With IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS and IBM Enterprise PL/I for z/OS, decades of IBM 
ff2 fs0
experience in application development can be used to integrate COBOL and PL/I with web 
ff2 fs0
services, XML, and Java. Such interoperability makes it possible to capitalize on existing IT 
ff2 fs0
investments, while smoothly incorporating new, web-based applications into the 
ff2 fs0
infrastructure.
ff2 fs0
z/OS, XL C/C++, and XL C/C++ for Linux on z Systems help with creating and maintaining 
ff2 fs0
critical business applications that are written in C or C++ to maximize application 
ff2 fs0
performance and improve developer productivity. These compilers transform C or C++ source 
ff2 fs0
code into executable code that fully leverages the Z architecture. This transformation is 
ff2 fs0
possible thanks to hardware-tailored optimizations, built-in functions, performance-tuned 
ff2 fs0
libraries, and language constructs that simplify system programming and boost application 
ff2 fs0
runtime performance.
ff2 fs0
Compilers such as COBOL, PL/I, and z/OS v2.3 XL C/C++ are inherently optimized on the 
ff2 fs0
IBM z14 because they use floating point registers rather than memory or fast mathematical 
ff2 fs0
computations. Using compilers that take advantage of hardware enhancements is key to 
ff2 fs0
improving application performance, reducing CPU usage, and lowering operating costs.
ff2 fs0
The IBM z14 also offers release-to-release improvements for Java. Combined with 
ff2 fs0
cryptography acceleration, the z14 can deliver improvements in throughput per core. The new 
ff2 fs0
z14 pause-less garbage collection capability provides improvements in throughput per core 
ff2 fs0
as well. Because of shorter, more consistent Java response times, the z14 achieves both 
ff2 fs0
improvements without significantly affecting overall throughput. So for Java applications that 
ff2 fs0
must remain highly responsive, enabling the new garbage collection mode is a good option.

2.1  Models and upgrade paths 
ff2 fs0
The z14 has an assigned machine type (MT) of 3906, which uniquely identifies the central 
ff2 fs0
processor complex (CPC). The z14 is offered in five models (M01, M02, M03, M04, and 
ff2 fs0
M05
ff2 fs3
1
ff2 fs0
). All z14 models use seven, eight, nine, or ten processor unit cores in five or six 
ff2 fs0
processor unit single chip modules in one CPC drawer. Spare processor units, system assist 
ff2 fs0
processors (SAPs), and one integrated firmware processor (IFP) are integral to the system 
ff2 fs0
and are present in all models of the z14.
ff2 fs0
Table 2-1 provides a summary that includes the number of characterizable processor units, 
ff2 fs0
SAPs, and spare processor units for the various models. For an explanation of processor unit 
ff2 fs0
characterization, see “PU characterization” on page 24.
ff4 fs1
Table 2-1   z14 model summary (machine type 3906)
ff2 fs0
The z14 offers 269 capacity levels. There are 170 capacity levels based on the number of 
ff2 fs0
physically used central processors (CPs), plus up to 99 additional subcapacity models for the 
ff2 fs0
first 33 CPs. There is also one model for all Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) or all Internal 
ff2 fs0
Coupling Facility (ICF) configurations.

Figure 2-1   z14 upgrade paths
ff2 fs0
On the z14, concurrent upgrades (explained in Chapter 4, “Strengths of the z14 platform” on 
ff2 fs0
page 59) are available for CPs, IFLs, ICFs, z Systems Integrated Information Processors 
ff2 fs0
(zIIPs), and SAPs. However, concurrent processor unit upgrades require that additional 
ff2 fs0
processor units are physically installed, but not activated at a previous time.
ff2 fs0
If an upgrade request cannot be accomplished in the existing configuration, a hardware 
ff2 fs0
upgrade is required in which one or more CPC drawers are added to accommodate the 
ff2 fs0
wanted capacity. On the z14, additional CPC drawers can be installed concurrently. However, 
ff2 fs0
upgrading from any z14 model to model M05 is disruptive because this upgrade is only 
ff2 fs0
supplied as a new system.
ff2 fs0
Spare processor units are used to replace defective processor units and there are always two 
ff2 fs0
spare processor units on a z14. In the rare event of a processor unit failure, one of the spare 
ff2 fs0
processor units is immediately and transparently activated and assigned the characteristics of 
ff2 fs0
the failing processor unit.
ff1 fs2
2.2  Frames and cabling
ff2 fs0
The z14 is always a two-frame system: The <ff5 fs6>A Frame <ff2 fs0>and the <ff5 fs6>Z Frame<ff2 fs0>. It can be delivered as </ff2 fs0></ff5 fs6></ff2 fs0></ff5 fs6>
ff2 fs0
an air-cooled system or as a water-cooled one. 
ff2 fs0
The two frames form the z14. The number of PCIe drawers can vary based on the number of 
ff2 fs0
I/O features. For a new build system, a combination of up to five PCIe I/O drawers can be 
ff2 fs0
installed. PCIe I/O drawers can be added concurrently.
ff2 fs0
In addition, the z14 (both new builds and MES orders) offers top-exit options for the fiber optic 
ff2 fs0
and copper cables used for I/O and power. These options (
ff5 fs6

Cabling<ff2 fs0>) give you more flexibility in planning where the system resides, potentially freeing you </ff2 fs0>
ff2 fs0
from running cables under a raised floor and increasing air flow over the system.
ff2 fs0
The radiator-cooled z14 models support installation on raised floor and non-raised floor 
ff2 fs0
environments. For water-cooled models, only the raised floor option is available.

2.3  CPC drawers
ff2 fs0
The z14 is a multiple CPC drawer system that can hold up to four drawers in the A Frame.
ff2 fs0
Each CPC drawer contains the following elements: 
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Single chip modules:</ff2>
ff2 fs0
– Five or six PU single chip modules, each containing seven, eight, nine, or ten 
ff2 fs0
processor unit cores (water-cooled).
ff2 fs0
– One storage controller single chip module, with a total of 672 MB L4 cache.
ff2 fs0
Single chip modules are described in 2.3.1, “Single chip modules” on page 22. Also, see 
ff2 fs0
Table 2-1 on page 18 for the model summary and the relation between the number of CPC 
ff2 fs0
drawers and number of available processor units.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Memory:</ff2>
ff2 fs0
– A minimum of 320 GB and a maximum of 32 TB of memory (excluding 192 GB HSA) is 
ff2 fs0
available for client use. See Table 2-2 on page 25 for details.
ff2 fs0
– Either 15, 20, or 25 memory DIMMs are plugged in a CPC drawer.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Fanouts:</ff2>
ff2 fs0
The CPC drawer provides up to 10 PCIe Gen3 fanout adapters to connect to the PCIe I/O 
ff2 fs0
drawers and ICA SR coupling links, and up to four InfiniBand fanout adapters for 
ff2 fs0
12x InfiniBand and 1x InfiniBand coupling links.
ff2 fs0
Each fanout has one, two, or four ports: 
ff2 fs0
– One-port PCIe 16 GBps I/O fanout, each supporting one domain in 32-slot PCIe I/O 
ff2 fs0
drawers.
ff2 fs0
– ICA SR two-port PCIe fanout for coupling links (two links, 8 GBps each).
ff2 fs0
– HCA3-O 12x InfiniBand fanout for coupling links (two ports at 6 GBps each). 
ff2 fs0
– HCA3-O LR 1x InfiniBand fanout for coupling links (four ports, 5 Gbps each).
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Two Distributed Converter Assemblies (DCAs) that provide power to the CPC drawer.</ff2>

ff2 fs0
As shown in Figure 2-4, all CPC drawers are interconnected with high-speed communications 
ff2 fs0
links through the L4 shared caches. The z14 has 672 MB of L4 cache per CPC drawer.
ff4 fs1
Figure 2-4   <fs0>z14</fs0> CPC drawer communication topology
ff2 fs0
The design used to connect the processor unit and storage control allows the system to be 
ff2 fs0
operated and controlled by the IBM Processor Resource/Systems Manager™ (PR/SM™) 
ff2 fs0
facility as a memory-coherent symmetrical multiprocessor (SMP) system.
ff1 fs5
2.3.1  Single chip modules
ff2 fs0
A CPC drawer has five PU single chip modules (SCMs) for models M01 through M04 or six 
ff2 fs0
PU SCMs for model M05, and one storage control (SC) SCM. Each PU SCM has seven, 
ff2 fs0
eight, nine, or ten active PU cores, and L1, L2, and L3 caches. The SC SCM holds the L4 
ff2 fs0
cache.
ff2 fs0
Figure 2-5 on page 23 depicts the logical cluster structure for a model M05, showing the 6 PU 
ff2 fs0
SCMs, the SC SCM, and their connections. For models M01 through M04, the PU SCM to the 
ff2 fs0
far left in Logical Cluster 1 is not present. The number of PU cores on each of the PU SCMs 
ff2 fs0
can range from 7 to 10 for all models.

ff4 fs1
Figure 2-5   <fs0>z14</fs0> M05 CPC drawer structure 
ff2 fs0
For z14, two CPC drawer configurations are offered with 41 or 49 processor units. All the 
ff2 fs0
models employ CPC drawers with 41 processor units except for the model M05, which has 
ff2 fs0
four CPC drawers with 49 active processor units, for a total of 196 processor units (170 can 
ff2 fs0
be configured for use). 
ff2 fs0
Each storage control SCM includes 672 MB shared eDRAM cache, interface logic for up to 
ff2 fs0
six PU SCM each, and SMP fabric logic. The SC SMC is configured to provide a single 672 
ff2 fs0
MB L4 cache that is shared by all PU cores in the CPC drawer. This amount of cache 
ff2 fs0
provides a total of 2.68 GB of cache if all four CPC drawers are implemented, yielding 
ff2 fs0
outstanding SMP scalability for real-world workloads.
ff1 fs5
2.3.2  Processor unit
ff2 fs0
Processor unit (PU) is the generic term for a IBM z/Architecture processor. Each PU is a 
ff2 fs0
superscalar processor with the following attributes:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Up to six instructions can be decoded per clock cycle.</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Up to ten instructions can be in execution per clock cycle.</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Instructions can be issued out-of-order. The PU uses a high-frequency, low-latency </ff2>
ff2 fs0
pipeline, providing robust performance across a wide range of workloads.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Memory accesses might not be in the same instruction order (out-of-order operand </ff2>
ff2 fs0
fetching).
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Most instructions flow through a pipeline with varying numbers of steps for different types </ff2>
ff2 fs0
of instructions. Several instructions can be in execution at any moment, subject to the 
ff2 fs0
maximum number of decodes and completions per cycle.
ff1 fs0

ff1 fs7
PU cache
ff2 fs0
The on-chip cache for the PU (core) works in this way:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Each PU core has an L1 cache (pr8 KB cache for </ff2>
ff2 fs0
instructions and a 128 KB cache for data. 
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Each PU core has a private L2 cache, with 4 MB D-cache (“D” stands for data) and 2 MB </ff2>
ff2 fs0
I-cache (“I” stands for instruction). 
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Each PU SCM contains a 128 MB L3 cache that is shared by all PU cores in the SCM. The </ff2>
ff2 fs0
shared L3 cache uses eDRAM. 
ff2 fs0
This on-chip cache implementation optimizes system performance for high-frequency 
ff2 fs0
processors, with cache improvements, new Translation/TLB2 design, pipeline optimizations, 
ff2 fs0
and better branch prediction.
ff1 fs7
PU sparing
ff2 fs0
Hardware fault detection is embedded throughout the design, and is combined with 
ff2 fs0
comprehensive instruction-level retry and dynamic PU sparing. This function provides the 
ff2 fs0
reliability and availability that is required for true mainframe integrity.
ff1 fs7
On-chip cryptographic hardware
ff2 fs0
Dedicated on-chip cryptographic hardware for each PU core includes extended key and hash 
ff2 fs0
sizes for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), and 
ff2 fs0
support for UTF8 to UTF16 conversion. This cryptographic hardware is available with any 
ff2 fs0
processor type, for example CP, IBM zIIP, and IFL.
ff1 fs7
Software support
ff2 fs0
The z14 PUs provide full compatibility with existing software for z/Architecture, and extend the 
ff2 fs0
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to enable enhanced functionality and performance. Several 
ff2 fs0
hardware instructions that support more efficient code generation and execution are 
ff2 fs0
introduced in the z14:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Compression call (CMPSC) </ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Hardware decimal floating point (HDFP)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Transactional Execution Facility</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Runtime Instrumentation Facility </ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) </ff2>
ff2 fs0
These features are further described in Chapter 4, “Strengths of the z14 platform” on 
ff2 fs0
page 59.
ff1 fs7
PU characterization
ff2 fs0
PUs are ordered in single increments. The internal system functions, which are based on the 
ff2 fs0
configuration that is ordered, characterize each PU into one of various types during system 
ff2 fs0
initialization, which is often called a power-on reset (POR) operation. Characterizing PUs 
ff2 fs0
dynamically without a POR is possible by using a process called 
ff5 fs6
Dynamic Processor Unit 
ff5 fs6
Reassignment
ff2 fs0
. A PU that is not characterized cannot be used. Each PU can be characterized 
ff2 fs0
as follows:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Central processor (CP)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) processor</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>z Systems Integrated Information Processor (zIIP)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Internal Coupling Facility (ICF) </ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>System assist processor (SAP)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Integrated firmware processor (IFP)</ff2>
ff2 fs1
Chapter 2. IBM z14 hardware overview  <ff1 fs0>25</ff1 fs0>
ff2 fs0
At least one CP must be purchased with a zIIP or before a zIIP can be purchased. You can 
ff2 fs0
purchase up to two zIIPs for each purchased CP (assigned or unassigned) on the system. 
ff2 fs0
However, an LPAR definition can go beyond the 1:2 ratio. For example, on a system with two 
ff2 fs0
CPs, a maximum of four zIIPs can be installed. An LPAR definition for that system can contain 
ff2 fs0
up to two logical CPs and four logical zIIPs. Another possible configuration is one logical CP 
ff2 fs0
and three logical zIIPs.
ff2 fs0
Converting a PU from one type to any other type is possible by using the 
ff5 fs6
Dynamic Processor 
ff5 fs6
Unit Reassignment
ff2 fs0
 process. These conversions happen concurrently with the operation of the 
ff2 fs0
system.
ff1 fs5
2.3.3  Memory
ff2 fs0
Maximum physical memory size is directly related to the number of CPC drawers in the 
ff2 fs0
system. Typically, a system has more memory installed than was ordered because part of the 
ff2 fs0
installed memory is used to implement the redundant array of independent memory (RAIM) 
ff2 fs0
design. On the z14, this configuration results in up to 8 TB of available memory per CPC 
ff2 fs0
drawer and up to 32 TB for a four-drawer system. 
ff2 fs0
The hardware system area (HSA) on the z14 has a fixed amount of memory (192 GB) that is 
ff2 fs0
managed separately from client memory. However, the maximum amount of orderable 
ff2 fs0
memory can vary from the theoretical number due to dependencies on the memory 
ff2 fs0
granularity.
ff2 fs0
Table 2-2 lists the maximum memory sizes for each z14 model.
ff4 fs1
Table 2-2   <fs0>z14</fs0> memory per model
ff2 fs0
On z14 systems, the granularity for memory orders is 64 - 512 GB. Table 2-3 shows the 
ff2 fs0
memory increments, depending on installed memory.

ff1 fs0
26<fs1>  <ff2>IBM z14 Technical Introduction</ff2></fs1>
ff2 fs0
Physically, memory is organized in these ways:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>A CPC drawer always contains a minimum of 320 GB of installed memory, of which </ff2>
ff2 fs0
256 GB is usable by the operating system.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>A CPC drawer can have more installed memory than is enabled. The excess memory can </ff2>
ff2 fs0
be enabled by a Licensed Internal Code load.
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Memory upgrades are first satisfied using already installed but unused memory capacity </ff2>
ff2 fs0
until it is exhausted. When no more unused memory is available from the installed cards, 
ff2 fs0
either the cards must be upgraded to a higher capacity, or a CPC drawer with more 
ff2 fs0
memory must be installed.
ff2 fs0
When an LPAR is activated, PR/SM tries to allocate processor units (PUs) and the memory of 
ff2 fs0
an LPAR in a single CPC drawer. However, if that is not possible, PR/SM will use memory 
ff2 fs0
resources located in any CPC drawer. For example, if the allocated PUs span more than one 
ff2 fs0
CPC drawer, PR/SM attempts to allocate memory across that same set of CPC drawers 
ff2 fs0
(even if all required memory is available in just one of those CPC drawers).
ff2 fs0
No matter which CPC drawer the memory is in, an LPAR has access to that memory after it is 
ff2 fs0
allocated. Despite the CPC drawer structure, the z14 is still an SMP system because the PUs 
ff2 fs0
have access to all the available memory.
ff2 fs0
A memory upgrade is considered to be concurrent when it requires no change of the physical 
ff2 fs0
memory cards. A memory card change is disruptive when no use is made of Enhanced 
ff2 fs0
Drawer Availability (EDA). In a multiple CPC drawer system, a single CPC drawer can be 
ff2 fs0
concurrently removed and reinstalled for a repair with EDA. For a description of EDA, see 
ff4 fs0
IBM 
ff4 fs0
z14 Technical Guide<ff2>, SG24-8451"fc0".</ff2>
ff2 fs0
For model upgrades involving the addition of a CPC drawer, the minimum usable memory 
ff2 fs0
increment (256 GB) is added to the system. During an upgrade, adding a CPC drawer is a 
ff2 fs0
concurrent operation, as is adding physical memory in the new drawer.
ff1 fs7
Concurrent memory upgrade
ff2 fs0
If physical memory is available, memory can be upgraded concurrently by using Licensed 
ff2 fs0
Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC), as described. The 
ff5 fs6
plan ahead memory function<ff2 fs0> </ff2 fs0>
ff2 fs0
that is available with the z14 enables nondisruptive memory upgrades by having in the system 
ff2 fs0
pre-plugged memory (based on a target configuration). Pre-plugged memory is enabled 
ff2 fs0
through an LICCC order that is placed by the client.
ff1 fs7
Redundant array of independent memory
ff2 fs0
RAIM technology makes the memory subsystem, in essence, a fully fault-tolerant N+1 design. 
ff2 fs0
The RAIM design automatically detects and recovers from failures of dynamic random access 
ff2 fs0
memory (DRAM), sockets, memory channels, or dual inline memory modules (DIMMs). 
ff2 fs0
The RAIM design is fully integrated in the z14, and has been enhanced to include one 
ff2 fs0
Memory Controller Unit (MCU) per processor chip, with five memory channels and one DIMM 
ff2 fs0
per channel. A fifth channel in each MCU enables memory to be implemented as RAIM. This 
ff2 fs0
technology has significant reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) capabilities in the 
ff2 fs0
area of error correction. Bit, lane, DRAM, DIMM, socket, and complete memory channel 
ff2 fs0
failures, including many types of multiple failures, can be detected and corrected.

2.3.4  Hardware system area
ff2 fs0
The HSA is a fixed-size, reserved area of memory that is separate from the client-purchased 
ff2 fs0
memory. The HSA is used for several internal functions, but the bulk of it is used by channel 
ff2 fs0
subsystem functions. 
ff2 fs0
The fixed-size 192 GB HSA for z14 is large enough to accommodate any LPAR definitions or 
ff2 fs0
changes, thus eliminating most outage situations and the need for extensive preplanning.
ff2 fs0
A fixed, large HSA allows the dynamic I/O capability of the z14 to be enabled by default. It 
ff2 fs0
also enables the dynamic addition and removal of the following features:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>LPAR to new or existing channel subsystem (CSS)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>CSS (up to six can be defined in z14)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Subchannel set (up to four can be defined in z14)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Devices, up to the maximum number permitted, in each subchannel set</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Cryptographic adapters</ff2>
ff1 fs2
2.4  I/O system structure
ff2 fs0
The z14 supports the following type of internal I/O infrastructure:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Generation 3 PCIe-based infrastructure for PCIe I/O drawers (PCIe Gen3)</ff2>
ff2 fs0
The PCIe I/O infrastructure consists of the following features:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>PCIe Gen3 fanouts in the CPC drawers that support 16 GBps connectivity to the PCIe I/O </ff2>
ff2 fs0
drawer
ff2 fs0
The InfiniBand I/O infrastructure (carry forward only) consists of the following features:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>InfiniBand fanouts in the z14 CPC drawer support for 12x InfiniBand and 1x InfiniBand </ff2>
ff2 fs0
coupling links.

ff2 fs0
Figure 2-6 shows a high-level view of the I/O system structure for the z14.
ff4 fs1
Figure 2-6   <fs0>z14</fs0> I/O system structure
ff2 fs0
The z14 supports four fanout types (for fanout location, see Figure 2-7 on page 29), which are 
ff2 fs0
at the front of the CPC drawer: 
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>ICA SR</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>HCA3-O (z14 is the last Z platform to support this feature)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>HCA3-O LR (z14 is the last Z platform to support this feature)</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>PCIe Gen3</ff2>
ff2 fs0
The HCA3-O LR fanout includes four ports. The PCIe Gen3 fanout has one port, and the 
ff2 fs0
other fanouts have two ports.
ff2 fs0
The following types of internal I/O connectivity support the PCIe I/O drawer:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>PCIe connections to the PCIe I/O drawers.</ff2>
ff2 fs0
For coupling link connectivity (Parallel Sysplex and STP configuration), the z14 supports the 
ff2 fs0
following link types:
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>ICA SR</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>12x InfiniBand coupling link</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>1x InfiniBand coupling link</ff2>
ff3 fs0
� <ff2>Coupling Express LR</ff2>
ff2 fs0
The z14 CPC drawer (Figure 2-7 on page 29) can have up to 10 1-port PCIe Gen3 or 2-port 
ff2 fs0
ICA PCIe coupling fanouts (numbered LG03 to LG12) and up to four 2-port or 4-port 
ff2 fs0
InfiniBand coupling fanouts for each CPC drawer (numbered LG13 to LG16). All coupling 
ff2 fs0
fanouts support Parallel Sysplex connectivity.
ff2 fs0
For systems with multiple CPC drawers, the locations of the PCIe Gen3 fanouts are 
ff2 fs0
configured and plugged across all drawers installed for maximum availability. This 
ff2 fs0
configuration helps ensure that alternate paths maintain access to critical I/O devices, such 
ff2 fs0
as disks and networks.

ff2 fs0
The PCIe I/O drawer (see Figure 2-8) is a two-sided drawer that is 7U high. I/O features can 
ff2 fs0
be installed in both sides. The drawer contains 32 slots, four switch cards (two in the front and 
ff2 fs0
two in the rear). These features support four I/O domains that each contain eight features of 
ff2 fs0
any type (FICON Express16S+, FICON Express16S, FICON Express8S, OSA-Express6S, 
ff2 fs0
OSA-Express5S, OSA-Express4S, Crypto Express6S, Crypto Express5S, zEDC Express, 
ff2 fs0
10GbE RoCE Express, 10GbE RoCE Express2, zHyperLink Express, and Coupling Express  
ff2 fs0

ff2 fs0
redundant cooling to the PCIe I/O Drawer.

ff1 fs2
2.5  Power and cooling
ff2 fs0
The z14 meets the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning 
ff2 fs0
Engineers (ASHRAE) Class A3 specifications. "fc1"ASHRAE is an organization that is devoted to 
ff2 fs0
the advancement of indoor-environment-control technology in the heating, ventilation, and air 
ff2 fs0
conditioning industry.
ff1 fs0
30<fs1>  <ff2>IBM z14 Technical Introduction</ff2></fs1>
ff2 fs0
The power and cooling system of the z14 builds on that of its predecessor, the IBM z13, with 
ff2 fs0
several newly developed technologies. However, the underlying power service specifications 
ff2 fs0
of the z14 are almost identical to its predecessors. Total power consumption with the 
ff2 fs0
maximum system configuration has increased only by about 5% compared to those previous 
ff2 fs0
models.
ff2 fs0
A closed, internal water cooling loop is used to cool single chip modules in the CPC drawers 
ff2 fs0
of the z14. Extracting the heat from the internal water loop can be done either with a radiator 
ff2 fs0
(air-cooled system) or a water cooling unit (water-cooled system). Conversion from air to 
ff2 fs0
water cooled systems, and vice versa, is not available.
ff1 fs5
2.5.1  Radiator (air) cooling option
ff2 fs0
The cooling system in the z14 is redesigned for better availability and lower cooling power 
ff2 fs0
consumption. The radiator design is a closed-loop water cooling pump system for the single 
ff2 fs0
chip modules in the CPC drawers. It is designed with N+1 pumps, blowers, controls, and 
ff2 fs0
sensors. The radiator unit is cooled by air.
ff1 fs5
2.5.2  Water cooling option
ff2 fs0
The z14 continues to offer the choice of using a building’s chilled water to cool the system by 
ff2 fs0
employing water cooling unit (WCU) technology. The single chip modules in the CPC drawer 
ff2 fs0
are cooled by an internal, closed, water cooling loop. In the internal closed loop, water 
ff2 fs0
exchanges heat with building-chilled water (provided by the client) through a cold plate.
ff2 fs0
In addition to the single chip modules, the internal water loop also circulates through two heat 
ff2 fs0
exchangers that are in the path of the exhaust air in the rear of the frames. These heat 
ff2 fs0
exchangers remove approximately 60-65% of the residual heat from the I/O drawers.
ff2 fs0
The z14 operates with two fully redundant WCUs. One WCU can support the entire load, and 
ff2 fs0
replacement of a WCU is fully concurrent. During a total loss of building-chilled water or if 
ff2 fs0
both water cooling units fail, the rear door heat exchangers cool the internal water cooling 
ff2 fs0
loop.
ff1 fs5
2.5.3  High Voltage Direct Current power feature
ff2 fs0
With the optional High Voltage Direct Current (HV DC) power feature, the z14 can directly 
ff2 fs0
connect to DC power input and improve data center energy efficiency by removing the need 
ff2 fs0
for an extra DC-to-AC inversion step. This feature can help achieve both data center UPS and 
ff2 fs0
power distribution energy savings.
ff1 fs5
2.5.4  Power considerations
ff2 fs0
The z14 operates with two sets of redundant power supplies. Each set has i
ff2 fs0
power cords or pair of power cords, depending on the number of Bulk Power Regulator (BPR) 
ff2 fs0
pairs installed. Power cords attach a 3-phase, 50/60 Hz, 200 - 480 V AC power source or 
ff2 fs0
380 - 520 V DC power source. The loss of just one power supply has no effect on system 
ff2 fs0
operation.
ff2 fs1
Chapter 2. IBM z14 hardware overview  <ff1 fs0>31</ff1 fs0>
ff2 fs0
The optional Balanced Power Plan Ahead feature is available for future growth, also assuring 
ff2 fs0
adequate and balanced power for all possible configurations. With this feature, downtime for 
ff2 fs0
upgrading a system is eliminated because the initial installation includes the maximum power 
ff2 fs0
requirements in terms of BPRs and power cords. The Balance Power Plan Ahead feature is 
ff2 fs0
not available with DC and 1-phase power cords.
ff2 fs0
Additional single-phase outlets (customer provided) are required for ancillary equipment such 
ff2 fs0
as the Hardware Management Console and its display.
ff2 fs0
Specific power requirements depend on the cooling facility that is installed, the number of 
ff2 fs0
CPC drawers, and the number and type of I/O units that are installed. You can find maximum 
ff2 fs0
power consumption tables for the various configurations and environments in
