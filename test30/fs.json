        "For systems with multiple CPC drawers, the locations of the PCIe Gen3 fanouts are configured and plugged across all drawers installed for maximum availability. This configuration helps ensure that alternate paths maintain access to critical I/O devices, such as disks and networks.", 
        "The PCIe I/O drawer (see Figure 2-8) is a two-sided drawer that is 7U high. I/O features can be installed in both sides. The drawer contains 32 slots, four switch cards (two in the front and two in the rear). These features support four I/O domains that each contain eight features of any type (FICON Express16S+, FICON Express16S, FICON Express8S, OSA-Express6S, OSA-Express5S, OSA-Express4S, Crypto Express6S, Crypto Express5S, zEDC Express, 10GbE RoCE Express, 10GbE RoCE Express2, zHyperLink Express, and Coupling Express  LR). Two DCAs provide redundant power, and two air moving devices (AMDs) provide redundant cooling to the PCIe I/O Drawer.", 
        "More details about the supported I/O features of the z14 are available in Chapter 3, \u201cSupported features and functions\u201d on page 33.", 
        "The z14 meets the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Class A3 specifications. <>ASHRAE</> is an organization that is devoted to the advancement of indoor-environment-control technology in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning industry.", 
        "30<fs1>  <ff2>IBM z14 Technical Introduction</ff2></fs1>", 
        "The power and cooling system of the z14 builds on that of its predecessor, the IBM z13, with several newly developed technologies. However, the underlying power service specifications of the z14 are almost identical to its predecessors. Total power consumption with the maximum system configuration has increased only by about 5% compared to those previous models.", 
        "A closed, internal water cooling loop is used to cool single chip modules in the CPC drawers of the z14. Extracting the heat from the internal water loop can be done either with a radiator (air-cooled system) or a water cooling unit (water-cooled system). Conversion from air to water cooled systems, and vice versa, is not available.", 
        "The cooling system in the z14 is redesigned for better availability and lower cooling power consumption. The radiator design is a closed-loop water cooling pump system for the single chip modules in the CPC drawers. It is designed with N+1 pumps, blowers, controls, and sensors. The radiator unit is cooled by air.", 
        "The z14 continues to offer the choice of using a building\u2019s chilled water to cool the system by employing water cooling unit (WCU) technology. The single chip modules in the CPC drawer are cooled by an internal, closed, water cooling loop. In the internal closed loop, water exchanges heat with building-chilled water (provided by the client) through a cold plate.", 
        "In addition to the single chip modules, the internal water loop also circulates through two heat exchangers that are in the path of the exhaust air in the rear of the frames. These heat exchangers remove approximately 60-65% of the residual heat from the I/O drawers.", 
        "The z14 operates with two fully redundant WCUs. One WCU can support the entire load, and replacement of a WCU is fully concurrent. During a total loss of building-chilled water or if both water cooling units fail, the rear door heat exchangers cool the internal water cooling loop.", 
        "With the optional High Voltage Direct Current (HV DC) power feature, the z14 can directly connect to DC power input and improve data center energy efficiency by removing the need for an extra DC-to-AC inversion step. This feature can help achieve both data center UPS and power distribution energy savings.", 
        "The z14 operates with two sets of redundant power supplies. Each set has i", 
        "power cords or pair of power cords, depending on the number of Bulk Power Regulator (BPR) pairs installed. Power cords attach a 3-phase, 50/60 Hz, 200 - 480 V AC power source or 380 - 520 V DC power source. The loss of just one power supply has no effect on system operation.", 
        "The optional Balanced Power Plan Ahead feature is available for future growth, also assuring adequate and balanced power for all possible configurations. With this feature, downtime for upgrading a system is eliminated because the initial installation includes the maximum power requirements in terms of BPRs and power cords. The Balance Power Plan Ahead feature is not available with DC and 1-phase power cords.", 
        "Additional single-phase outlets (customer provided) are required for ancillary equipment such as the Hardware Management Console and its display.",
